        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><em>Last Updated: 2025</em></p>
        <p>
            Flip Clock Online ("we", "us", or "our") provides a minimalist online flip clock that runs in your browser.
            This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and what choices you have.
            We aim to keep things simple and privacy-friendly.
        </p>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We design Flip Clock Online to collect only the minimum information needed to keep the site running and improve it over time.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Local preferences stored on your device:</strong>
                When you change options such as 12/24-hour format, whether to show seconds, background color, or font color,
                these settings are saved in your browser’s local storage. This data never leaves your device and is not sent
                to our servers or any third party.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Anonymous usage statistics (Google Analytics):</strong>
                We use Google Analytics ("GA") to understand how people use Flip Clock Online so we can improve the experience.
                GA may collect information such as the pages you visit, your approximate location (e.g., country or region),
                device and browser type, language, referral source, and how long you stay on a page.
                This data is aggregated and we do not use it to personally identify you.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>To provide and operate the service:</strong>
                Your local settings are used solely to remember how you like your clock to look and behave on your device.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>To improve Flip Clock Online:</strong>
                Anonymous analytics data helps us understand which features are used, which devices and browsers we should support,
                and where users might encounter issues, so we can make the service better.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>To maintain performance and reliability:</strong>
                Usage data and error information help us monitor the stability and performance of the website.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
            Flip Clock Online uses only one third-party service: Google Analytics. We do not embed any other third-party
            plugins, advertising networks, or tracking scripts beyond GA.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Google Analytics:</strong>
                We use Google Analytics to collect anonymous usage statistics. Google may use cookies and similar technologies
                to gather information about your interaction with our site. This information is processed by Google to provide us
                with aggregated reports (for example, how many people visited a page and from which countries).  
                For details on how Google uses data, please see
                <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                    Google’s Privacy &amp; Terms
                </a>.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            We do not use Google Analytics for personalized advertising, and we do not combine analytics data with any account
            system, because Flip Clock Online does not require accounts or logins.
        </p>

        <h2>Cookies and Similar Technologies</h2>
        <p>
            Cookies are small text files stored on your device. Flip Clock Online itself does not set cookies for its core features;
            your preferences are stored using your browser’s local storage. However, Google Analytics may use cookies or similar
            technologies to collect anonymous usage data.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Analytics cookies:</strong>
                These cookies (set by Google Analytics) help us understand how visitors interact with the site, such as which pages
                are most popular, how users move around the site, and how long they stay. This information is used only in aggregate
                form to improve the service.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            You can control or disable cookies through your browser settings. In addition, you can learn more about how Google uses
            cookies and how to manage your preferences by visiting
            <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/cookies" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                Google’s Cookies Policy
            </a>.
        </p>

        <h2>Data Retention</h2>
        <p>
            Your display preferences are stored locally in your browser until you clear them (for example, by clearing your browser
            data or using a different device or browser).  
            Analytics data collected by Google Analytics is retained according to the data retention settings configured in our
            Google Analytics account and Google’s own policies.
        </p>

        <h2>Data Security</h2>
        <p>
            We are committed to keeping your information as secure as reasonably possible. All traffic to Flip Clock Online is served
            over HTTPS to help protect data in transit. While no method of transmission or storage is completely secure, we aim to
            follow good practices and keep the amount of data we handle to a minimum.
        </p>

        <h2>Your Choices</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Browser controls:</strong>
                You can clear or block local storage and cookies through your browser’s settings. Doing so may reset your clock
                preferences, but Flip Clock Online will continue to work.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Analytics opt-out:</strong>
                If you prefer not to be measured by Google Analytics across websites, you can install the official Google Analytics
                opt-out browser add-on available from Google.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>
            Flip Clock Online is a general-purpose tool and is not specifically directed at children. We do not knowingly collect
            personal information from children. If you believe that we may have unintentionally collected personal data from a child,
            please contact us and we will take steps to address the issue.
        </p>

        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>
            We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time as our service or legal requirements change. When we make changes,
            we will update the “Last Updated” date at the top of this page. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy
            periodically to stay informed about how we handle your information.
        </p>
